Or should I say it's more like my gf, as soon as I look away, she cheated on me. What an absolute... lovely person. I'm probably an masochist, loving pain, loving soooo much pain. The pain of doing these labworks, despite they're dead simple, I want to make it special, more fun, but if I were to be asked, 'can you explain what you did', I probably can't answer it."
