# What is this

- A collection of source codes that help me not die during the run of this course.
And this folder help carry my final so hard

## For USTH students

- Try to write the code yourself, Prof will check any copy and paste line.
DON'T even think about only changing the variable names. Prof will kill you
- This is just some idea you can use when doing your labworks
- The labwork 6 isn't fully finished (it's too hard, and I'm still too lazy).
