1. TODO:
        - Install Python (anaconda) and some packages (scipy, matplotlib)
        - Do the tutorial: https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/
        - Carry out the labwork, write a report
        - Submit the report before 11:59PM May 07, 2023
2. Signals:
        - plot the signal Input_1kHz_15kHz (in time domain)
        - convert into freqency, plot real/imaginary/magnitude/phase
        - using Inverse-FFT to get back to time domain
        - Comment?
3. Systems:
        - plot the Impulse_response
        - convert into freqency, plot real/imaginary/magnitude/phase
        - calculate the output using time convolution/frequency multiplication
        - convert into Freq, plot real/imaginary/magnitude/phase.
        - Comment?
4. Filtering:
        - Modify the impulse response to remove low frequency components
        - ECG signal:
            - analyse the frequency representation
            - let it through the lowpass filter, comments?
            - Add some noise (white noise/high frequency noise), and try to remove that noise
