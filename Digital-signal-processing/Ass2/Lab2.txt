Lab 2 - Designing Filters
Tung Tran Hoang

Due May 13, 11:59â€¯PM

Part 1:
    - Designing filters (FIR, IIR): labwork 1 but with different systems
        - FIR filters (Bartlett, Hamming, Blackman)
        - IIR filters (Chebyshev, Butterworth, Bessel)
    - visualize the frequency representation (dB)
    - Comparing input and output both in time domain and frequency domain
    - Are these filters different?
Part 2:
    - Implement a highpass filter to remove the low-frequency component in labwork 1
Part 3:
    - Create your own signal: record your voice, add noise and using filter to (partially) re move the noise
