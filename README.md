# Repository what?

- A collection of coding problems during my time at USTH (University of Science
  and Technology of Hanoi)

---

# What is it used for?

- Probably to pass down to student who are taking the same course, having few
  example code would be a tremendous help.
- For USTH students, try to do it first, ok? You will have different ways to
  solve the same problem so don't just copy.

  github: **https://github.com/Incomprehensibilitative/**
